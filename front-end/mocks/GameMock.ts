      "About the game": "There is no right way to live an afterlife... The world fell to pieces ages ago and all history crumbled to dust. Magic has brought you back from the dead, but your mind has eroded and your purpose is unclear. Play as either a Friend- a skeleton warrior assembled of bones from a mass grave; or a Cursed One- the fleshy walking Corpse of an embalmed aristocrat. Travel, explore, and build alongside your faction members, or stalk the territory of your enemies in search for players to kill and bases to crumble. You wake with a voice whispering in your head, leading you ahead on a quest of knowledge and power. Venture outward and explore the ever expanding Realm of the Dead. You must settle the land and build a new home as you wander the desert in search of pages of an old book, The Lore, which may hold the key to salvation. Participate in First-Person open-world PvP and PvE combat, as well as recurring daily events. Craft spells and magic trinkets to gear up in a completely customizable loadout. Throw fireballs, create giant sandstorms, hurl meteors and glide from the highest peaks with your spellcasting powers. Build a base with free-placing gigantic stone monoliths. Make your own Stonehenge and live in it. Place a Throne and establish a community to gain benefits from being a good neighbor. Make new friends and skeleton dance together, or insult each other with animated emotes. Animyst has been in open, playable, development since 2018 and is made by a tiny team of two mortals. All player feedback is seriously considered. Many gameplay changes and updates have come directly from player suggestions. Come join the discussion on our open Discord channel (link can be found in game) and influence Animyst as it evolves into a full PVP MMORPG unlike any other. Experience the world as its built and populated with more and more creatures, spells, and features every month.
